# UNCG ISM647 ML1 Assignment

This repository contains the project files for the ISM647 ML1 assignment at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. The project is focused on demonstrating and applying machine learning concepts using Python. This project serves as a practical application of machine learning techniques learned in the ISM647 course.

## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment is to apply various machine learning algorithms to solve a specific problem or to demonstrate the application of different data science techniques. The project might involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow (optional, depending on the project requirements)

### Installation
