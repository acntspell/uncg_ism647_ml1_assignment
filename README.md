# UNCG ISM647 ML1 Assignment

This repository contains the project files for the ISM647 ML1 assignment at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. The project is focused on demonstrating and applying machine learning concepts using Python. This project serves as a practical application of machine learning techniques learned in the ISM647 course.

## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment is to apply various machine learning algorithms to the given problem:

A target marketing campaign for a bank was undertaken to identify segments of customers who are likely to respond to a variable annuity (insurance product) marketing campaign. For this project, data was collected from 32,264 banking customers during a three-month period. The data set was created with one output variable and 47 input variables. The output variable is a binary variable called Ins. It indicates whether the customer bought an insurance product. The data set called Insurance Purchase.

The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model training, and evaluation using ANN, logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models.
